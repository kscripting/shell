= shell 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT features:

* Move shell test classes from kscript to the library
* dry-run, with test output provider
* printing of commands
* Command for encapsulating commands?
* Throw on exitCode != 0 and/or skipErrors
* verifier for different types like in assertk/assertj
* log masking (shallow - in printout and deep in stderr/stdout); masking list of the words; is the design with Streams valid for that?
* Encoding of special characters in output (\n, \, etc.)
* Interface for ShellExecutor (to allow mocking)
* Printing Output of commands
* Possibility of parametrization of commands (properties) + masking (for tests and interoperability)
* Silent mode ()
* Use https://github.com/JetBrains/pty4j[PTY4j] instead of ProcessBuilder to read color codes from input and append them to output (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45789329/java-capture-process-output-with-color)
* Providing different types of shell (e.g. 'sh' or 'zsh') and executing without shell
